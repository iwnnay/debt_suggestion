      <span>Why use this tool?</span>
      <p>The purpose of this tool is to advice consumers of the fastest way to pay
      off debt. Unlike other tools this tool will take into account all aspects
      of the debt you&#39;ve entered. This includes the amount owed, interest,
      and minimum payment. Other calculators will simply rely on amount owed to
      order the repayment plan, which may add on a significant amount of time
      and money onto the final amount paid.</p>
      <span>Instructions:</span>
      <p>Use the form below to add debt information and watch the calculator go to work.<br/>
      Be as specific as possible. You can change and remove things later.</p>
