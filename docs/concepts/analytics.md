## Snowballing
This is a simple concept where the person trying to pay off debt will pay
every penny that is earned back through eliminating interest back into paying
off more of their debt.

### Example
Month 1: Debt is $300 at 20% interest, the minimum payment is $45

Month 2: Debt is now $260.62, the minimum payment is now $39.10. If you
continue to pay the $45 you're snowballing $5.90.

## No snowballing
This is paying only the minimums plus the amount specified every month. This puts
money back in your pocket quicker, but you will end up paying much more in interest

## Lowest First
This is an easy to understand strategy. Once you finish off paying a debted account
you find the next debted account with lowest amount owed. This is usually the
best strategy if all interest rates are in the same area and there are no special
items in your accounts.

## Smart Whole Account
This is the first level break down of permutation in the calculation. This will
work through all potential paydowns grouped by the account

## Smart Monthly
This is a future concept of this application where the app will make a schedule
month by month of payments on locked accounts to figure out the fastest possible
way to drive down your debts

## Special Items
These can be discounted, prorated, or temporary low/no APRs
